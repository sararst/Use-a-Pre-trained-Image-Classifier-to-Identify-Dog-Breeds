Answer: 
No, the three model architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg with the same breed. 
- resnet: french bulldog
- vgg: bull mastiff
- alexnet: boxer



2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
No, they classified in different ways.
- resnet:
    dog2 bloodhound, sleuthhound, dog1 french bulldog
- vgg:

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
All the three model architectures correctly classified frog and bucket to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
Among the three models, ResNet performed best for the uploaded images. 
- it achieves a 75% match rate, correctly classifying 3/4 images
- correctly identifies Dog_01 as french bulldog, while VGG and AlexNet were not exactly correctly
- correctly classifies frog and bucket, and identified them as not dogs
