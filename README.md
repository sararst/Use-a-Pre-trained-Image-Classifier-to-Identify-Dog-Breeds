## Image Classification for a City Dog Show

In this project, I used a created image classifier to identify dog breeds.

Description:
"Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.

Some people are planning on registering pets that arenâ€™t actual dogs.

You need to use an already developed Python classifier to make sure the participants are dogs."

Tasks:
Using my Python skills, I had to determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
I had to determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. 
I had to time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime. The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.
